These are the new requirements added to the old one. 
Under are some new bugs we spoke about in class. 

**So in order to do this, I thought that would be better to separate the bugs and features into areas that correspond to 
our prior expertise or interests. For example, we will need to create a new database and connect it to the application. 
Thus those who took a database class should work on this issue. 
Those with data structure experience should work on issues that requires that knowledge. We have to submit it by tomorrow
Sat 3/28 so any other ideas or suggestions are welcomed.
We would also need to divide the bugs and new features into those categories.**




PERFOMANCE
 - The application’s backend will process and enter the input data into the database.
 - The program shall be able to respond to the system’s mouse instructions only - in a prompt or instantaneous manner. (.2 milliseconds)
RELIABILITY
 - In case of crash the program should have a "home" button that will allow the user to return to the default screen.
 - The application must be tested for new bugs prior to delivery. If bugs are found, they must be fixed prior to delivery date. 
 - The application must have a database (locally?) that will store and back up all the input data.
USABILITY
- The interface must be checked for its navigation simplicity and user friendliness. Keeping in mind who the target users are.
- A student should not have the opportunity to add a specialist or have access to the "add Specialist" screen.
